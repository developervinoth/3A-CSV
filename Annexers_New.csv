plastic cover on usm2 arm 2 on the patient trolley was replaced the system was tested and verified as ready for use no image or video clip for the reported event was submitted for review a medical review was performed by an isi medical safety officer and the following information was provided based upon the information in the description of events there is insufficient information to determine what caused the patients asystole cardiac arrest beyond a notation of noncritical bleeding thought to originate from an intercostal vessel that was controlled there is very little information about the procedure it is unknown if there were any complications that resulted from the abdominal portion gastric mobilization and hiatal dissection of the procedure it is further unknown what was found during the conversion to an open thoracotomy and how the aorta was injured in order to determine the root cause of this event additional investigation will need to be performed this complaint is being reported due to the following conclusion during a da vinciassisted esophagectomy transthoracicchest anastomosis procedure during the beginning of the thoracic part an idiopathic bleeding came up which was controlled with the cadiere forceps the synchroseal and the tipup grasper were the other instruments installed at that time the bleeding was controlled and was probably due to the injury of an intercostal vessel and was described as not critical about approximately 5 mins after this bleeding event the patient went into asystole suddenly the surgeon together with the cardiac surgeon and thoracic surgeon decided to convert the procedure to open further unspecified nonda vincirelated complications occurred resulting in aortic injury the surgery was completed but the patient died in the evening the cause of death is unknown blank mdr fields followup was attempted but the missing patient information was either unknown unavailable not provided or not applicable field is blank as the
